# Phlash Installation Guide

## Back end

The back end uses [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), a Python-based micro web framework.

### Virtual environment

First, create a virtual environment inside our project's `back-end` directory using `requirements.txt`. This file contains all of the project's required dependencies and packages.

```bash
$ cd back-end
$ python3 -m venv phlash-venv/
$ source phlash-venv/bin/activate  # activate the environment
(phlash-venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # new fancy command prompt
```

> :information_source: You can replace `phlash-venv/` with a different name for your environment.

> :information_source: An *active* virtual environment is indicated by the command prompt prefixed with the name of the active environment in parentheses. 

To make sure your active environment is using the right interpreters, libraries, etc., check the value of your `PATH`. Your `PATH` should look more or less like this. 

```bash
(phlash-venv) $ echo $PATH
~/Phlash/back-end/phlash-venv/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
```

You can also check that your shell knows to use our project's local Python instance.

```bash
(phlash-venv) $ which python3
~/Phlash/back-end/phlash-venv/bin/python3
```

When you're done working on the project, exit the environment.

```bash
(phlash-venv) $ deactivate
$                           # old familiar command prompt
```

### Running Flask

We can now run Flask because it has been installed in our virtual environment, along with other packages. At this point, you should still be in the `back-end` directory with your environment activated. 

```bash
(phlash-venv) $ pwd
~/Phlash/back-end
```

#### Development

Use the following commands to run the Flask server locally.

```bash
(phlash-venv) $ export FLASK_ENV=development  # optional
(phlash-venv) $ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

> :information_source: If `FLASK_ENV` is set to `development`, the `flask` command will enable debug mode, and `flask run` will enable the interactive debugger and reloader.

#### Production

To run in production, see Flask's [deployment options](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/#deployment).

## Front end

The front end uses [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/), a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

### Running Vue.js

#### Development

While running the back end in one terminal, open another terminal and run the front end.

```bash
$ cd front-end
$ npm install
```

> :information_source: `npm install` downloads dependencies defined in the `package.json` file and generates a `node_modules` folder with the installed modules.

Then, run a webserver on localhost using the [`serve` command](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html#vue-cli-service-serve). 

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

You should now be able to browse to `localhost:5050` and navigate through Phlash.

#### Production

To run in production, see Vue CLI's [deployment guidelines](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#general-guidelines). Generally, you would need to run `npm run build` instead `npm run serve` for deployment. The [`build` command](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/cli-service.html#vue-cli-service-build) produces a production-ready bundle in the `dist/` directory.

See [this](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#docker-nginx) for deploying Phlash inside a docker container.
